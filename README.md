## 🎯 About

CARE CONNECT is a comprehensive mobile application designed to bridge the gap between compassionate citizens and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Built with Flutter and powered by Firebase, this platform creates a trusted ecosystem that enables seamless donations, volunteer engagement, and transparent communication between users and NGOs.

The application addresses the critical disconnect between people's desire to contribute to social causes and the lack of accessible, transparent platforms to do so effectively.
